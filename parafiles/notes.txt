OutputIREV.java input file, line by line:

Line 1: Index of the starting simulation (usually start at 1 unless a previous process was interrupted somewhere).

Line 2: Index of final simulation, should be greater than or equal to the starting simulation index.  Totla number of simulations = final sim index - start sim index.

Line 3: Number of entities present in simulation.

Line 4: Number of timesteps to run for.

Line 5: Number of equilibration timesteps to run for before recording output.

Line 6: Number of available activities.

Line 7: Name of the room file to be used.

Line 8: Values of busyness parameters of the model, separated by commas.

Line 9: Values of distance parameters of the model, separated by commas.

Line 10: Values of desire parameters of the model, separated by commas.

Line 11: Number whether to include Markov model.  1 = yes.  Anything else = no.

Line 12: Number whether to enforce new next destination constraint.  1 = yes.  Anything else = no.

Line 13: Number whether to vary the masses of the entities.  1 = vary masses.  Anything else = don't vary.

Line 14: Number whether to vary the sizes/radii of the entities.  1 = vary sizes.  Anything else = don't vary.

Line 15: Number whether to vary the preferred speeds of the entities.  1 = vary speeds.  Anything else = don't vary.

Line 16: Number whether to produce entity trajectory output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 17: Number whether to produce destination occupancy output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 18: Number whether to produce entity destination output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 19: Number whether to produce destination distance output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 20: Number whether to produce destination desirability output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 21: Number whether to produce entity schedule output, 1 = yes, anything else = no.

Line 22: Number whether entities have given initial positions, masses, sizes and preferred speeds.  1 = yes.  Anything else = no.

Line 23: Filepath of where to store any desired outputs.

If agents do not have initial positions and properties, then the file is not read any further.

If agents have initial positions and properties, then the rest of the file is read:
On each line for every entity:
x-coordinates - one per entity
y-coordinates - one per entity
mass of each entity
size of entity
preferred speed of each entity
